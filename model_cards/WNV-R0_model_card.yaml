description: >
  WNV-R0 is a dynamic epidemiological model designed to estimate the basic
  reproduction number (R₀) for West Nile Virus transmission across geographic
  regions using environmental, entomological, and host population data.

intended_use:
  in_scope:
    - Seasonal and regional WNV transmission risk assessment
    - Comparative R₀ analysis across regions or years
    - Scenario analysis under alternative climate or vector conditions
    - Public health preparedness and surveillance planning
  out_of_scope:
    - Individual-level risk prediction
    - Real-time outbreak detection
    - Automated policy decision-making

architecture:
  type: Deterministic compartmental model
  characteristics:
    - Vector–host transmission dynamics
    - Temperature-dependent biological rates
    - Environmental forcing
    - Seasonal modulation

training_data:
  sources:
    - CDC West Nile Virus Surveillance Data
    - ERA5 Climate Reanalysis (Copernicus)
    - Entomological surveys
  time_period: TBD
  geographic_coverage: TBD
  preprocessing:
    - Missing value imputation
    - Temperature-dependent rate transformations
    - Seasonal normalization

    - name: RMSE
      value: TBD
    - name: MAE
      value: TBD
    - name: Correlation Coefficient
      value: TBD

assumptions:
  - Stable transmission dynamics within a season
  - Homogeneous spatial mixing
  - No explicit modeling of human behavior or interventions

limitations:
  data:
    - Sparse surveillance data in some regions
    - Underreporting of cases
  technical:
    - Requires complete climate and vector inputs
    - Deterministic structure
  biological:
    - No strain-specific variation
    - Simplified host dynamics
  geographic:
    - Optimized for temperate and subtropical regions
  temporal:
    - Seasonal use only, not real-time

known_biases:
  - Bias toward regions with strong surveillance systems

fairness_considerations:
  - Outputs should not be interpreted as equal risk across regions
  - Lower R₀ does not imply lower vulnerability

potential_harms:
  - Overreliance without expert review
  - Misallocation of public health resources

risk_mitigation:
  - Expert epidemiological review
  - Uncertainty communication
  - Regular validation and recalibration

maintenance:
  update_frequency: Annual or as new data become available
  versioning: Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  deprecation_policy: Maintain prior versions for 2 years

datasets:
  - CDC West Nile Virus Activity
  - Copernicus Climate Data Store (ERA5)
