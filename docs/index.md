# Welcome to heiplanet_models' documentation!

If you're in a hurry and know what you are doing, go to the ['Getting started' section](getting_started.md) directly for installation instructions. Alternatively, you can first read up on the [basic design philosophy](basic_design.md), and then go to ['Getting started' part](getting_started.md) afterwards.

After that, learn how to use the provided models in the ['Using existing models' section](using_existing_models.md) and how to customize them or build new ones in the ['Create new models' part](create_new_model.md).

If you find any bugs, or have an idea for a feature that should be added, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/ssciwr/onehealth-model-backend/issues), or if you know right away what to do to fix it, feel free to contribute to this project by opening a pull request with your suggested code [here](https://github.com/ssciwr/onehealth-model-backend/pulls). 

Have fun!
